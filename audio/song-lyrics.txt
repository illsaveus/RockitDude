I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To splode  them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each evil to understand
The power that's inside

Rockit Dude
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
RockitDude
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
Rockit Dude
Gotta splode 'em all
Yeah
Rockit Dude

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Rockit Dude!
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny

Rockit Dude
In a world we must defend
Rockit Dude!
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
Rock IT Dude
Gotta splode 'em all
Gotta splode 'em all
Gotta splode 'em all
Yeah
